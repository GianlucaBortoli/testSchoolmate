# testSchoolmate

This is the project for the [Security Testing course](https://sites.google.com/site/sectestunitn/) at the University of Trento.

The work is the following:
* use _pixy_ to discover the XSS vulnerabilities in the web application
* create a proof of concept attack (using _JWebUnit_)
* fix the PHP code
* show that the attack is no longer possible
